# Node.js API Gateway

## Goals

* Everything should be controllable through a YAML configuration file.
* The Gateway could be used programmatically or as CLI program
* The developer should be able to use which API framework should be used (express.js, fastify, restify, ...)
* It should be possible to build aggregates of routes

## Philosophy

* Only TypeScript code
* Small dependency footprint
* Only use well known dependencies

## TODO

* Move to object oriented programming style
  * Use dependency injection pattern
  * Use inverson of control container (like inversify.js)
* Provide as executable
* Allow multiple API frameworks (for now express is hard-coded)

## How to use

$ npm i node-api-gateway
