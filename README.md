# Node.js express.js Gateway

> This is the node-express-gateway package which provides a small and easy API gateway. If you need more power and are looking for the express-gateway package click here: https://github.com/expressgateway/express-gateway

## Goals

* Everything should be controllable through a YAML configuration file.
* The Gateway could be used programmatically or as CLI program
* The developer should be able to use which API framework should be used (express.js, fastify, restify, ...)
* It should be possible to build aggregates of routes

## Philosophy

* Only TypeScript code
* Small dependency footprint
* Only use well known dependencies

## TODO

* Move to object oriented programming style
  * Use dependency injection pattern
  * Use inverson of control container (like inversify.js)
* Provide as executable
* Allow multiple API frameworks (for now express is hard-coded)
